- Function: detect which are folders and which are files.
    - DONE on view, we can now apply folder and file icons accordingly.
- Function: code to allow users execute zip or unzip command
- CSS: icons depending on file type or if it is a folder.
- CSS: add hover effects
- OS: create a script that will accept a path parameter then do a zip operation based on path supplied by the PHP call.

VERSION 1.0:
    Contains basic folder and file browser. It executes a command from the server to execute ZIP or UNZIP. htdocs login also will be added

VERSION 2.0:
    May contain a treeview of the directory structure but if there would be a problem we will just do that on VERSION 3.0
    This version will contain a richer file browsing experience. Asside from the directory names and files the details such as
        created date, modified date, and size are also displayed. To achieve this, we will not rely on the array index number 
        captured from the directory_map() function. We will try to loop into the entries and try to extract meta data using other
        directory and file helpers. Those data are inserted into our own multi-dimentional array. This will allow us to have
        further control and open new possibilities. This will also include previous version bugs.

VERSION 3.0
    The treeview must be included in this version. Asside from treeview we will try to execute other commands such as copying, moving,
        and renaming files and folders. We will also integrate richer user interface. We will integrate session based login instead of 
        htdocs.
