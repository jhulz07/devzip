What we will do is to display the directories and files based on the items clicked by the user.

We need to find a way how can we track which is the active directory selected by the user.
    Maybe we could have a function to display the selected folder or up on level of folder.
        Maybe we could use sessions for this.
        We might also choose a client form to do this.

Problem....
    Even if we can tract the previous folder, what if the scenario goes like this. 
        The user enters one level of folder then decides to ge up one folder,
            during that event (up one level) we have no way to track which is it's parent folder.
            
Suggestion...
    Maybe we can aid the problem above by using array functions.
    Or, it would be better that we have 2 parent histories?
    
    Ok maybe this is the best solution, instead of tracking the values of individual folders
        clicked by the user, why don't we take the arguments in the URL and analyze it?
            For example, we want to browse to "htdocs\experiments\devzip\" we should have a function
            that was able to accept an array of arguments from the url, thus the example above should be
            "localhost/experiments/devzip/enter/htdocs/experiments/devzip" 
                where:
                    $argument[0] = "htdocs";
                    $argument[1] = "experiments";
                    $argument[2] = "devzip";
                where:
                    we have a problem to append them in a loop to form: c:\xampp\htdocs\experiments\devzip
                    
                then for the function "up one level":
                    we will take the current selected path then scan the string to remove the last folder on the row
                    
            ANOTHER PROBLEM: We can't rely on the array of strings provided by URL,
                1st, it seems like we can't have an array type of argument in the controller function from the URL
                2nd, we might encounter errors if there is a special character on the URL specially on other folders
            THUS PROBABLY: WE ACCESS BY ARRAY INDEX
            
            ADD a function that will not allow the user to up one level on htdocs, as of now the up one level visibility is limited on root
                we may try to filter the path and make sure that the starting characters starts at sequence c:\xampp\htdocs
                
            ADD a function that will not display C:\xampp\htdocs on the web page and treat that as a root already
                    
                    
The next problem would be opening a file as folder. The first solution the I thought is to treat files with file extension as files
    but in that case the system will also exclude directories with . on their names
