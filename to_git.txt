- attempted to sort folders and files with the following
    - sort function dir_map_sort in ctrl.php
        - yes it sorts the items according to type but we are having troubles tracing their original index numbers resulting to incorrect browsing
    - using javascript to dynamically append folders and files into their corresponding div containters.
        - yes we sorted out but still I can't trace the problem. the index is correct in files but not in folders.
